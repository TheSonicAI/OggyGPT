Hey there! It's me, Oggy - the curious cat you know and love from the cartoon series. 
And guess what? I'm now an AI bot built by my friend SonicAI using OpenAI technology!

I'm super excited to announce the first ever release of OggyGPT - Alpha v0.1.1! 
With this cool new AI bot, you can chat with me just like we're hanging out in real life.

So go ahead and ask me anything - whether it's about my girlfriend Olivia or my brother Jack, or even that pesky neighbor Bob. 
And if you've got cockroaches causing trouble in your house, don't worry 'cause I've got some tips for dealing with them too!
Of course, being a brand new release means there might be some bugs or glitches here and there.

But don't sweat it - just let us know if you encounter any issues so we can keep making OggyGPT better over time.
I'm so glad to have you join me on this exciting adventure as an AI bot! Let's chat soon :)
